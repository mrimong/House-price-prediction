The main business priority is to transform the rental and real estate industry with the help of natural language processing for better investments and earning more profits. We aim to achieve:
●First, to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts house prices 
●Second, to offer prescriptive advice to maximize property values and aid buyers in making informed decisions in the Austin housing market

We have created predictive models to understand the price prediction based on different factors and have also set up a Google cloud platform solution for easy scaling and hosting of the models.
